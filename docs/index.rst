Libhostile is a lightweight library to be used with `LD_PRELOAD` which will intentially break certain libc calls at various intervals. Specifically designed to cause random failures in network functions and memory allocation.

The tool was originally designed by `Data Differential <http://www.datadifferential.com/>`_ as part of `Gearman <http://gearman.org/>`_ but is now being continued as an independent project maintained by `Andrew Hutchings <https://github.com/LinuxJedi>`_.
